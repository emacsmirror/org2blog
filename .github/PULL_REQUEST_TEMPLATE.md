This is most common for contributions with new features. Reflect on the fact that although the code may be simple, the feature might introduce, refine, or entirely redefine a concept: each of which significantly changes how you think about using Org2Blog. 80% of the time, new feature contributions require thoughtful, detailed, and example-driven updates to the system documentation.
