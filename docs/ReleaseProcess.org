- [X] What release tag is this? \rarr v1.1.16
- [ ] Create and checkout this branch
- [ ] Update copyright dates
- [X] Open and update [[../HISTORY.org][History]] as you go
- [ ] Update software versions in ~org2blog-defi~:
  - Start emacs with no init file and check: ~emacs --no-init-file&~
  - [ ] Emacs version
  - [ ] Org version
  - [ ] For each used library note [internal or external] and [tag] and maybe
    update it in ~org2blog-defi~ and regenerate things

    - [ ] Regenerated? [Yes or No] Yes
  - Open ~org2blog.el~
- [X] The release version number appears in multiple files. Update them with
  this helper function by following these steps:
  - Open ~org2blog.el~
  - Update ~org2blog/wp-version~ with the new version
  - Evaluate the buffer
  - Call ~org2blog-def-update-artifacts~
    - This step /may/ be fragile. It automates the manual steps of updating
      version numbers by searching for string matches, and sometimes those
      values change. If the function fails, try visiting each of the relevant
      files in the function body, moving the cursor to the first line, and
      trying again. If that fails, then please file an Issue Report so we can
      look at it together.
  - Stage it and review the results.
- [ ] Bring codebase up to expectations in [[CONTRIBUTING.org][Contributing]].
  - [ ] Byte compile changed files
    - Expected and non critical warnings

  - [ ] No: Complete [[../org2blog-test-system.el][System Test Program and Test Plan]]
    - Start Emacs in an empty environment before loading Org2Blog and perform the testing by starting Emacs like this: ~emacs --no-init-file~
    - The test is identical to running manually. Primarily used in case you don't have a blog and you are pointing at the test server.
    - Did you run this and why?
- [ ] Build package with [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa#build-scripts][MELPA]]: First with metaweblog and second org2blog
  - [ ] Update MELPA from Github
  - [ ] Configure to point at this branch for example. The key thing is that you are pointing it at the branch. When it builds the package verify it. The build script is sensitive to recipe formatting btw. You must enable file variables when you open it.

Just released Org2Blog v1.1.16

Just released Org2Blog v1.1.16:

- Underlining was broken
- Now it works

Code: https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog

Cross posting to:

- Org mode: Because it uses Org markup
- Emacs: Because its an application that runs on top of Emacs

Thank you for helping make Org2Blog better.

Happy Blogging!
