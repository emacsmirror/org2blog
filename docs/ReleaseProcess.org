- [ ] Copy this to a temp file or buffer and fill it out. This will get pasted into the commit message for the release
- [ ] Should should already be performing your release work in a branch. Make sure of that.
- [ ] The release version number appears in multiple files. Instead of manually updating all of them there is a function to do it. ~org2blog-def-update-artifacts~ visits the files and updates the correct settings. To use it:
  - Open ~org2blog.el~
  - Update ~org2blog-def--package~ with the new version number (~this-release~)
  - Evaluate it
  - Call ~org2blog-def-update-artifacts~
    - This step /may/ be fragile. It automates the manual steps of updating version numbers by searching for string matches, and sometimes those values change. If the function fails, try visiting each of the relevant files in the function body, moving the cursor to the first line, and trying again. If that fails, then please file an Issue Report so we can look at it together.
- [ ] Bring codebase up to expectations in [[CONTRIBUTING.org][Contributing]].
  - [ ] Byte compile source code files
  - [ ] Checkdoc
  - [ ] Package-Lint
- [ ] Complete [[../org2blog-test-system.el][System Test Program and Test Plan]]
  - Start Emacs in an empty environment before loading Org2Blog and perform the testing by starting Emacs like this: ~emacs --no-init-file~
  - The test is identical to running manually. Primarily used in case you don't have a blog and you are pointing at the test server.
  - Did you run this and why?
- [ ] Build package with [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa#build-scripts][MELPA]]
  - [ ] Make sure it installs and loads
  - [ ] Test using the package
- [ ] Update copyright dates
- [ ] Update [[../HISTORY.org][History]]
- [ ] Merge branch into ~master~ and tag the release
  - Note MELPA master and table downloads.
