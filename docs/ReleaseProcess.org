- [X] The release version number appears in multiple files. Update them with this helper function by following these steps:
  - Open ~org2blog.el~
  - Evaluate it
  - Call ~org2blog-def-update-artifacts~
    - This step /may/ be fragile. It automates the manual steps of updating version numbers by searching for string matches, and sometimes those values change. If the function fails, try visiting each of the relevant files in the function body, moving the cursor to the first line, and trying again. If that fails, then please file an Issue Report so we can look at it together.

    - Start Emacs in an empty environment before loading Org2Blog and perform the testing by starting Emacs like this: ~emacs --no-init-file~
    - The test is identical to running manually. Primarily used in case you don't have a blog and you are pointing at the test server.
    - Did you run this and why?
- [X] Build package with [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa#build-scripts][MELPA]]: First with metaweblog and second org2blog
  - [X] Update MELPA from Github
  - [X] Configure to point at this branch for example. The key thing is that you are pointing it at the branch. When it builds the package verify it. The build script is sensitive to recipe formatting btw. You must enable file variables when you open it.
