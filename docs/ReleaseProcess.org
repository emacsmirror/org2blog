    - Nothing significant
  - [X] ~git diff release_9.5.5 release_9.6.15 lisp/ox-html.el~

- Update ~org2blog/wp-version~ with the new version
- [X] Update software versions in ~org2blog-defi~
- [X] Eval buffer
- [X] Update copyright dates
- [X] The release version number appears in multiple files. Update them with
  this helper function by following these steps:
  - Remain in the same file
  - Call ~org2blog-def-update-artifacts~
    - This step /may/ be fragile. It automates the manual steps of updating
      version numbers by searching for string matches, and sometimes those
      values change. If the function fails, try visiting each of the relevant
      files in the function body, moving the cursor to the first line, and
      trying again. If that fails, then please file an Issue Report so we can
      look at it together.
  - Stage it and review the results.
- [X] Get new checkout of dev libs

  - [ ] Complete [[../org2blog-test-system.el][System Test Program and Test Plan]]
    - Start Emacs in an empty environment before loading Org2Blog and perform the testing by starting Emacs like this: ~emacs --no-init-file~
    - The test is identical to running manually. Primarily used in case you don't have a blog and you are pointing at the test server.
- [ ] Build package with [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa#build-scripts][MELPA]]: First with metaweblog and second org2blog
  - [ ] Update MELPA from Github
  - [ ] Configure to point at this branch for example. The key thing is that you are pointing it at the branch. When it builds the package verify it. The build script is sensitive to recipe formatting btw. You must enable file variables when you open it.
    #+begin_src elisp
(org2blog :fetcher github
          :repo "org2blog/org2blog"
          :branch "noautoloads"
          :files (:defaults "README.org" (:exclude "metaweblog.el")))
    #+end_src

    - make clean
    - make recipes/org2blog
    - open packages
    - open ~/.emacs.d/elpa
    - Delete the metaweblog and org2blog folder
  - [ ] Install it with ~package-install-file~. Open install folder and look
    at the headers: are they OK?
  - [ ] Test using the package versus using the source code.
- [ ] Create a Feature Request with this in it:
  #+begin_src gfm
This is a placeholder for when vX.Y.Z gets released.

It serves as a notification for users running into any issues.

When the [branch](https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog/tree/X.Y.Z) is merged I'll add a comment here.

After day or two when it seems OK I'll tag it.
  #+end_src
- [ ] Run grammar checker
  - [ ] At minimum on the =About= section
  - [ ] More: What did you also do?
    - Processed a lot of contractions
- [ ] Merge branch into ~master~ push it.
- [ ] Wait a day or two to make sure it's OK
- [ ] If you didn't do a merge, then commit the changes here
  - "Make v1.1.16 release in master"
- [ ] Prepare to later publish announcement on Reddit
  - Customize Message
        #+begin_src markdown
Just released Org2Blog vX.Y.Z

Just released Org2Blog vX.Y.Z:

- Underlining was broken
- Now it works

Code: https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog

Cross posting to:

- Org mode: Because it uses Org markup
- Emacs: Because its an application that runs on top of Emacs

Thank you for helping make Org2Blog better.

Happy Blogging!
