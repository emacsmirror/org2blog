* Introduction

Nice to meet you ðŸ˜„.

Wherever we end up going from here:

Thank you for spending your precious time and valued brainpowerâ€”it is truly appreciated!

This contribution guide exists so that you and other contributors will get the most out of your effort for the least amount of time and expenditure required. It is simpleâ€”we are looking for all and everything you view as a contribution.

* Areas To Contribute

- Improving documentation.
- Bug triage.
- Writing tutorials.
- Feature ideas.
- "Simple things" like spelling and grammar fixes, typo correction, white space, and formatting changes
- Refactoring.
- Support questions: yes, really! If you are facing it, then you can't be the only one. It is an opportunity to better the documentation, the package itself, or more. Create a [[https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog/issues/new]["Blank" issue type]] to ask your question since it is neither a bug report nor a feature request.
- Whatever things that /aren't/ listed here that /should be/.

* Contribution Expectations

- Documentation :: 80% of the time, your changes require either an update to the project documentation, the source code [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Documentation.html][documentation]], or *BOTH*.  The literal changes your contribution made is crystal clear: the commits explains everything. However, the context for your change, the thought process you followed, and examples of its use are not. There might be little to no documentation required for bug fixes and minor changes: it should be self-evident. For new features, though, assume that you will have to put some real thought into the new documentation. Assume that your fellow bloggers are unfamiliar with the feature area. You are introducing the feature area, the problem you faced using it, and the solution you created for them for the first time. 80% of the time, your fellow users are either using this feature for the first time, or have used it and won't precisely understand it solves. The saddest software is the one that never runs. Unless you update the documentation, other users will likely never learn about your contribution, and the code will essentially die. Consider it your duty, responsibility, and gift to future users to make your donation accessible in both the code and the documentation. Please take this as an opportunity to have some fun changing how other Org2Bloggers think: you are making the Org2Blog universe a better place and all of the greatly appreciate it. 
- Coding style and conventions :: The Emacs Lisp code should follow the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Tips.html][Emacs Lisp conventions]] and the [[https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-lisp-style-guide][Emacs Lisp Style Guide]].
- Grammar and Language :: Use a spell-checker like [[http://aspell.net/][Aspell]] and grammar-checker like [[https://languagetool.org/][LanguageTool]] for your docstrings and documentation. Find writing problems like weasel-words, passive-voice and duplicate words with [[https://github.com/bnbeckwith/writegood-mode][Writegood Mode]]. The best tool available today is [[https://grammarly.com/][Grammarly]], and I recommend it above everything else out there.
- Use quality-checking tools :: Use [[https://melpa.org/#/flycheck][flycheck]], [[https://github.com/purcell/package-lint][package-lint]] and [[https://github.com/purcell/flycheck-package][flycheck-package]] to help you identify common errors in package metadata and code. Use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Tips.html][checkdoc]] to make sure that your package follows the conventions for documentation strings.
- *Review existing issues* :: [[https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog/issues][The issue tracker]] may already have them solved; otherwise, they are a great place to start
- *The Future* :: [[https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog/blob/master/FUTURE.org][The future file]] may already have new features listed, and if it doesn't, then maybe it should. Either way, it might be a great place to start.
- *Accept the license* :: Org2Blog is licensed [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html][GPLv3]]: you understand and submit your code under those terms.

* Conclusion

That is it. That would be everything. If you made it this far: kudos to you for sticking around. Thank you for spending your time here. I hope you keep blogging and having fun with Org2Blog.

Thanks and have a great day.
