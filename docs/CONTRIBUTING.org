* Introduction

Nice to meet you ðŸ˜„.

Wherever we end up going from here:

Thank you for spending your precious time and valued brainpowerâ€”it is truly appreciated!

This contribution guide exists so that you and other contributors will get the most out of your effort for the least amount of time and expenditure required. It is simpleâ€”we are looking for all and everything you view as a contribution.

* Areas To Contribute

- Improving documentation.
- Bug triage.
- Writing tutorials.
- Feature ideas.
- "Simple things" like spelling and grammar fixes, typo correction, white space, and formatting changes
- Refactoring.
- Support questions: yes, really! If you are facing it, then you can't be the only one. It is an opportunity to better the documentation, the package itself, or more. Create a [[https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog/issues/new]["Blank" issue type]] to ask your question since it is neither a bug report nor a feature request.
- Whatever things that /aren't/ listed here that /should be/.

* Contribution Expectations

- Coding style and conventions :: The Emacs Lisp code should follow the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Tips.html][Emacs Lisp conventions]] and the [[https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-lisp-style-guide][Emacs Lisp Style Guide]].
- Grammar and Language :: Use a spell-checker like [[http://aspell.net/][Aspell]] and grammar-checker like [[https://languagetool.org/][LanguageTool]] for your docstrings and documentation. Find writing problems like weasel-words, passive-voice and duplicate words with [[https://github.com/bnbeckwith/writegood-mode][Writegood Mode]]. The best tool available today is [[https://grammarly.com/][Grammarly]], and I recommend it above everything else out there.
- Use quality-checking tools :: Use [[https://melpa.org/#/flycheck][flycheck]], [[https://github.com/purcell/package-lint][package-lint]] and [[https://github.com/purcell/flycheck-package][flycheck-package]] to help you identify common errors in package metadata and code. Use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Tips.html][checkdoc]] to make sure that your package follows the conventions for documentation strings.
- *Review existing issues* :: [[https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog/issues][The issue tracker]] may already have them solved; otherwise, they are a great place to start
- *The Future* :: [[https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog/blob/master/FUTURE.org][The future file]] may already have new features listed, and if it doesn't, then maybe it should. Either way, it might be a great place to start.
- *Accept the license* :: Org2Blog is licensed [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html][GPLv3]]: you understand and submit your code under those terms.

* Conclusion

That is it. That would be everything. If you made it this far: kudos to you for sticking around. Thank you for spending your time here. I hope you keep blogging and having fun with Org2Blog.

Thanks and have a great day.
